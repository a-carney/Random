ROUGH DRAFT
	In an era where digital interactions have become more prevalent than ever, the ability to control the spread of information has continued to be a major concern. One of the more important issues is the rise in online toxic language, specifically in social media forums. This toxic language, often referred to colloquially as things like "hate speech" or "cyberbully" can have significant impacts on the mental health of those who are targeted. As a result, there has been a signifigant effort to develop tools that can detect and prevent the spread of toxic information. Though many efforts are ongoing to block hate speech, less effort has been put into the development of tools that can cleanse the language of its toxic elements while preserving original context. This process, known as text detoxification, is discussed in this paper along with strategies that can be implemented. Although it is clear that many different strategies need to work together for this to completely work succesfully, this paper will also explain why the specific use of explainable artifical intelligence (XAI) and ensemble-based marchine learning models are critical to this accomplishment.



	The integration of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and ensemble-based machine learning models present a robust approahc to hate speech detection accross multiple platforms, enhancing both the accuracy of detection and the interpretability of the AIs decision making. This will ultimately lead to more trust in these tools and a more effective means of controlling the spread of hate speech. However, despite the many advancements in preventing hate speech, there has not been much research into "text detoxification" or the process of replacing the toxic phrase with more neutral language. This is an important step, as it will allow us to remove toxic language while still preserving the original meaning of the text.
